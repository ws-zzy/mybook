# Introduction

The world is flooded with information, however the information resides in a way that all of the information appears to be junk to a person from some other background. For example if you are from hardware background, the software information appears to be cryptic. For example in software world they use the word 'image' for a binary file that is obtained from a corresponding C program. Seriously if you dont know what an 'image file' is, then somehow jpeg or gifs come into your imagination. I have no idea why its called an 'image'. This techerature is an attempt to keep it very simple without the use of 'what-software-assumes-everyone-knows-by-birth' kind of jargon.
